db problems
  - insert into students
        sportID is not foreign key
        no foreign keys in any tables i think


        insert into injury report
         insert into injury_report (studentID, Date, Description, ATS_ID, InjuryID) values ('1',now(), 'sprained right ankle', '1', '2');


        Query Goals-

        All the injuries and dates for one player
        select students.FirstName, students.LastName,injuries.Name, injury_report.Description, injury_report.Date from students
        join injury_report on students.ID = injury_report.studentID
        join injuries on injury_report.InjuryReportID = injuries.injuriesID
        where students.FirstName = 'carter';

        All the injuries for a team grouped and counted
         select sports.Name, injury_report.Date, injury_report.Description from sports join injury_report on sports.sportsID = injury_report.studentID;
        all the injuries between two dates
        - maybe just a count of how many people came in the atr  that week

        Make sure we test a query from all database tables
